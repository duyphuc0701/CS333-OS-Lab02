* Question 1: Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
Answer:
This is the output of the stacktrace:
#0 syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:135
#1 0x000000000001e4e in usertrap () at kernel/trap.c:67
#2 0x505050505050505 in ?? ()

From the stack trace we can see that function usertrap() called syscall() function. 

* Question 2: What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent?
(Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
Answer:
The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 7, which represents the system call number for the exec system call. This is because
In the file user/initcode.S, before calling ecall, the code loads SYS_exec (whose value is defined as 7 in syscall.h)
into register a7 using the instruction: li a7, SYS_exec

* Question 3: What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
Answer:
The previous mode that the CPU was in is "user mode". This is because the value of sstatus register in binary is
100000000000000000000010010, so the SPP bit is 0.

* Question 4: Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
Answer:
The value of sepc is 0x000000008000212e, so we searched for that value in the file kernel/kernel.asm:
- The assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at is: lw	a3,0(zero)
- The register corresponds to the variable "num" is: a3

* Question 5: Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address
space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
Answer:
The kernel crashed because it loaded unused memory at address 0. It is confirmed by the fact that the value of register
"scause" is 13, which corresponds to "Load Page Fault" in RISC-V privileged instructions.

* Question 6: What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
Answer:
- The name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced is: initcode
- The process id of initcode is: 1
